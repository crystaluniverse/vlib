- Grid driver is a tool to interact with threefold grid to create deployments for networks, vms ,zdbs, gateways...etc
- It uses [this tool](https://github.com/threefoldtech/web3gw/tree/development_integration/griddriver) written in `golang` to do the needed stuff that vlang doesn't support e.g (substrate, rmb, ...)
- To create different kind of deployments follow the following
  - [create and update deployments](creating_updating_deployments.md)
  - [get contract](getting_contracts.md)
  - [cancel contract](canceling_contracts.md)
