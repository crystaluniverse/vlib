### OpenAPI Example

A simple example of how to use an OpenAPI server given an OpenAPI specification, with a custom handler to handle requests. The handler in this example echoes back the entire OpenAPI request object generated as the payload of the response.

To run:
```
chmod +x ${CODEROOT}/github/freeflowuniverse/crystallib/examples/web/openapi/server.vsh
${CODEROOT}/github/freeflowuniverse/crystallib/examples/web/openapi/server.vsh
```
